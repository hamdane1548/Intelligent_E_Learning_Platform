# Intelligent E-Learning Platform

An AI-powered e-learning platform designed to provide personalized learning experiences through intelligent tutoring, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and automated quiz generation.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build a modern educational platform that combines traditional learning management features with Artificial Intelligence capabilities. The platform provides:

* 📚 Course and learning content management
* 🤖 AI-powered assistance for students
* 🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for context-aware responses
* 📝 Automatic quiz generation from educational materials
* 👨‍🏫 Backend APIs for managing users, courses, quizzes, and AI services

## 🔄 CI/CD

CI/CD is not yet configured in this repository.

Planned CI (via GitHub Actions) will include:

* Running backend unit tests
* Executing API tests
* Static code analysis (e.g., SonarQube)
* Security checks
* Build verification before merging into the `main` branch
---

## 👥 Team Collaboration

This repository follows a feature-branch workflow:

```text
feature/*      → Development features
bugfix/*       → Bug fixes
develop        → Integration branch
main           → Production-ready code
```

Once CI is configured, pull requests to `main` must pass all CI checks before being merged.
